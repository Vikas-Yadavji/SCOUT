# SCOUT
Signal Correction and Uncertainty Quantification Toolbox in MATLAB

SCOUT is a MATLAB toolbox developed using Guide, which analyzes, characterizes, and corrects one-dimensional random signals. Specifically, it allows to check and correct for stationarity, detect spurious samples, check for normality, check for periodicity, filter, perform spectral analysis, determine the integral time scale, and perform uncertainty analysis on individual and on propagated signals. The novelty of SCOUT lies in combining these various methods into one compact and easy-to-use toolbox, which enables students and professionals alike to analyze, characterize, and correct for signals without expert knowledge. The program is oriented towards time traces, but an easy adaptation to spatial distributions can be performed by the user. SCOUT is available in two variants: a graphical user interface (GUI) and a script-based version.
